            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Albert Einstein
                (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a
                German-born theoretical physicist who is best known for
                developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made
                important contributions to quantum mechanics.
                 His
                mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc
                , which arises
                from special relativity, has been called "the world's most
                famous equation".He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in
                Physics for "his services to theoretical physics, and especially
                for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".
                Born in the German Empire, Einstein moved to Switzerland
                in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship
                the following year. In 1897,
                at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and
                physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss federal
                polytechnic school in Zurich, graduating in 1900. He acquired
                Swiss citizenship a year later, which he kept for the rest of his
                life, and afterwards secured a permanent position at the Swiss
                Patent Office in Bern. In 1905, he submitted a successful PhD
                dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1914, he moved to
                Berlin to join the Prussian Academy of Sciences and the
                Humboldt University of Berlin, becoming director of the
                Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in 1917; he also became a
                German citizen again, this time as a subject of the Kingdom of
                Prussia.
                In 1933, while Einstein was visiting the United
                States, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. Horrified by
                the Nazi persecution of his fellow Jews, he decided to
                remain in the US, and was granted American citizenship in
                1940.On the eve of World War II, he endorsed a letter to
                President Franklin D. Roosevelt alerting him to the potential
                German nuclear weapons program and recommending that
                the US begin similar research.
